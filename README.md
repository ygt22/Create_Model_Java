<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

The testing process consists of two steps:

* Testing processes

## Getting Started

After the model diagram of the design is created with the "graph editor", the relevant file is defined in the program.

An example model is given below:

The model.java file, which is created after the program is run, is then used in the testing process.
